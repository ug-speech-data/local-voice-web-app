# UG SPECCH DATA - FRONTEND
Our software facilitates the collection of transcribed audio data and parallel text to create Neural Machine Translation (NMT) datasets for five Ghanaian languages: Akan, Ewe, Ikposo, Dagaare, and Dagbani. With a user-friendly interface and advanced alignment algorithms, it ensures dataset accuracy. The tool also employs data augmentation and scalable techniques to support low-resource environments. As part of a larger project, we aim to scale up data collection to 100 languages across Africa by 2023. This software empowers NMT model development, fostering communication across diverse African languages.
